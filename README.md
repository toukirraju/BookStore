## Description 
The React Bookstore app is a web-based application that allows users to browse, search, and manage a collection of books. The app is built using React, Redux, and RTK Query for state management and server communication.

The app consists of several key features, including a homepage that displays a list of all books, a search bar that filters the book list based on user input, and a book detail page that provides more information about a specific book.

Users can also add new books to the collection and edit or delete existing ones. The app uses RTK Query's Mutation feature to send requests to the server for adding, editing, or deleting books.

In addition, the app includes a "Featured" tag that filters the book list to show only books marked as featured. All of these features are implemented using Redux and RTK Query to manage the application's state and handle server communication.


## Features


* Upon page load, the server will send the list of books to display.
* On the 'Add Book' page, when book information is submitted, it will be saved to the server using RTK Query's Mutation query, and the user will be redirected back to the 'Home' page.
* On the 'Book List' page, there are two tags on the right-hand side, 'All' and 'Featured'. If 'Featured' is selected, only the featured books will be displayed. If 'All' is selected, all books will be displayed. This functionality will be implemented on the client-side.
* The navigation menu includes a 'Search Bar', where users can search for books by title. The search results will be filtered and displayed in the 'Book List' section. If the search bar is left empty, all books will be displayed as usual.
* Clicking the 'Edit' icon on a card item will take the user to an edit page for that book. This will require the use of React Router. The edit form will be pre-populated with the book's existing information. Any changes made to the form will update the corresponding data on the server, and the user will be redirected back to the 'Home' page upon submission.
* Finally, when the 'Delete' button is clicked, the book will be deleted from the server.
